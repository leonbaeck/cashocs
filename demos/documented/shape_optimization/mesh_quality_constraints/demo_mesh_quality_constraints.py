# # Mesh Quality Constraints for Shape Optimization
#
# # Problem Formulation
#
# In this demo, we demonstrate cashocs capability of enforcing a certain mesh quality,
# which is given by the user. As model problem, we consider the one already considered
# in {ref}`demo_shape_poisson`, which we briefly recall here
#
# $$
# \begin{align}
#     &\min_\Omega J(u, \Omega) = \int_\Omega u \text{ d}x \\
#     &\text{subject to} \qquad
#     \begin{alignedat}[t]{2}
#         -\Delta u &= f \quad &&\text{ in } \Omega,\\
#         u &= 0 \quad &&\text{ on } \Gamma.
#     \end{alignedat}
# \end{align}
# $$
#
# For the initial domain, we use the unit disc
# $\Omega = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^2 \,\mid\, \lvert\lvert x \rvert\rvert_2 < 1 \}$ and the
# right-hand side $f$ is given by
#
# $$
# f(x) = 2.5 \left( x_1 + 0.4 - x_2^2 \right)^2 + x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 1.
# $$
#
# # Mesh Quality Constraints
#
# Our software cashocs has the option to enforce a certain mesh quality during the
# shape optimization. This is done by adding additional equality and inequality
# constraints, which act on the discretized geometry, i.e., the finite element mesh.
# These constraints are of the form
#
# $$
# \alpha \geq c \quad \text{ for all } \alpha \in \Omega_h,
# $$
#
# where $\alpha$ is some angle (in the case of a 2D triangular mesh) or dihedral
# angle (for a 3D tetrahedral mesh) and $c$ is a lower bound for this angle. Note that
# this constraint is posed for all angles $\alpha$ in the mesh (which is denoted by
# $\Omega_h$).
#
# :::{note}
# Note that many mesh quality criteria are either explicitly or implictly dependent on
# the (dihedral) angle of the mesh elements. For examples, we refer the reader to
# {py:mod}`cashocs.geometry.quality`. As a concrete example, consider the so-called
# skewness of the mesh, which is given by
#
# $$
# 1 - \max\left( \frac{\alpha - \alpha^*}{\pi - \alpha^*},
# \frac{\alpha^* - \alpha}{\alpha^* - 0} \right).
# $$
#
# It is easy to see, that this is maximal (i.e. has the value 1) for $\alpha = \alpha^*$
# and that the mesh quality deteriorates (i.e. it goes to 0) for either $\alpha \to 0$
# or $\alpha \to \pi$.
#
# With the help of the above constraint, the skewness of some triangular mesh is bounded
# by
#
# $$
# \min\left( \frac{2c}{\pi - \alpha^*}, \frac{c}{\alpha^*} \right),
# $$
#
# due to the fact that the above constraint implies that $\alpha \leq \pi - 2c$ for a
# triangular mesh (the sum of all triangular angles is $\pi$). A similar observation
# also holds true for a tetrahedral mesh (there, the sum of the dihedral angles is
# bounded between $2\pi$ and $3\pi$).
#
# For this reason, the above constraints enforce the quality in the mesh in the sense
# that no element can become degenerate during the optimization if the constraints are
# satisfied.
# :::
#
# :::{note}
# Note that for some meshes it might not be sensible to define the lower threshold for
# the (dihedral) angle globally, i.e., use a single value of $c$ for all cells, for
# example when using stretched elements for resolving boundary layers. Therefore,
# cashocs can either use a globally defined threshold $c > 0$ or a value of $c$ which
# is different for each cell in the mesh and depends on the angles in the initial mesh.
# In the latter case, the user can specify a factor $\varphi \in (0,1)$ and $c$ in
# element $k$ is chosen as $c_k = \phi \min_i \alpha_i$, i.e., it is chosen as $\varphi$
# times the minimum angle of the element. This choice still preserves the mesh quality
# as it ensures that the elements can not deteriorate.
# :::
#
# Of course, the constraints can only be satisfied up to a numerical tolerance, so
# that this tolerance also needs to be specified by the user. It is suggested that users
# try the default tolerance of 1e-2 first. For some problems, a larger tolerance, e.g.,
# 1e-1 might yield faster results, but sometimes it might be necessary to use a tighter
# tolerance.
#
# ## Implementation
#
# The complete python code can be found in the file
# {download}`demo_mesh_quality_constraints.py
# </../../demos/documented/shape_optimization/mesh_quality_constraints/demo_mesh_quality_constraints.py>`,
# and the corresponding config can be found in {download}`config.ini
# </../../demos/documented/shape_optimization/mesh_quality_constraints/config.ini>`.
#
# ### Solving the Problem without Mesh Quality Constraints
#
# Let us first consider solving the above problem without any mesh quality to see what
# happens. To do so, we follow {ref}`demo_shape_poisson`, with some minor modifications.

# This code is the same as before, the only difference is that the mesh quality for the
# initial and optimized meshes is computed and printed to the console. The output is
# given by

# Quality of the initial mesh: 6.391e-01
# Quality of the optimized mesh: 4.831e-01

#
# Hence, we observe that the mesh quality goes down quite a bit. Of course, the quality
# of the optimized mesh is still acceptable, nevertheless we use this as an example
# to show how cashocs can preserve the mesh quality.
#
# ### Solving the Problem with Mesh Quality Constraints
#
# For using the mesh quality constraints, the user only has to change the configuration
# file. To make this more obvious, we load the config file into the python script and
# modify the corresponding values directly there. Hence, our setup is very similar to
# before, i.e.,

# To specify the mesh quality constraints, we now modify the corresponding parameters

# of the elements (in degrees) which is done with

config.set("MeshQualityConstraints", "min_angle", "35.0")

# A minimum angle of 35Â°, as specified above, leads to a minimum skewness of the mesh of
# `0.5833` and since we consider a tolerance of `1e-2`, this means that we can
# expect a minimum skewness of `0.5733` for the mesh.
#
# :::{warning}
# Mesh quality constraints are implemented for all available methods for shape
# optimization, i.e., the gradient descent, nonlinear CG, and BFGS methods. However, the
# theory only works for the gradient descent method at the moment. Numerical examples
# suggest, that the method also works well with the NCG and BFGS methods, but there
# is no guarantee that this works, so use this with some care only.
# :::
#
# ::::{note}
# As we are solving the problem numerically, the constraints can only be satisfied up to
# a certain numerical tolerance. This can be specified with the line
#
# :::{code-block} python
# config.set("MeshQualityConstraints", "tol", "1e-2")
# :::
#
# A value of `1e-2` is the default and should work reasonably well for most problems. If
# the constraint handling takes too much time, a higher tolerance of `1e-1` might be
# useful for some problems. On the other hand, for problems requiring more strict
# handling of the constraints, a lower tolerance, such as `1e-3`, could be beneficial.
# ::::
#
# ::::{note}
# If one has a non-uniform mesh, e.g., for resolving boundary layers, then
# the user can, as explained above, define a factor $\varphi \in (0,1)$ which the angles
# of some element can become smaller. This can be done with the configuration parameter
# :::{code-block} python
# cfg.set("MeshQualityConstraints", "feasible_angle_reduction_factor", "0.5")
# :::
#
# This means that all (dihedral) angles of the mesh can become half (or a factor of
# $\varphi$ in general) of the minimum angle of the respective element.
#
# If both a {ini}`feasible_angle_reduction_factor` and {ini}`min_angle` are specified,
# then the minimum of both (on a per-element basis) is used to ensure that the initial
# mesh is feasible w.r.t. the constraints.
# ::::
#
# Finally, we can solve this problem with the lines
#

sop = cashocs.ShapeOptimizationProblem(e, bcs, J, u, p, boundaries, config=config)
sop.solve()

# To compare the solution with the mesh quality constraints, we also compute the
# mesh quality of the optimized mesh with the lines

optimized_mesh_quality = cashocs.compute_mesh_quality(mesh)
print(f"Quality of the initial mesh: {initial_mesh_quality:.3e}")
print(f"Quality of the optimized mesh: {optimized_mesh_quality:.3e}")

# and we get the following output
#
# :::{code-block} console
# Quality of the initial mesh: 6.391e-01
# Quality of the optimized mesh: 5.751e-01
# :::
#
# i.e. the mesh quality constraints have been successful in enforcing a higher mesh
# quality. In particular, we observe that the minimum allowed skewness of `0.5733` is,
# in fact, (numerically) achieved for the optimized mesh.
#
# Finally, we visualize the result with the following code
